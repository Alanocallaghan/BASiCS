version 0.1: (2015-04-20)

- Original release

version 0.1.1: (2015-04-21)

- Improved documentation

version 0.1.2: (2015-04-23)

- In 'BASiCS_Sim': change 'sum(phi)==n' by 'all.equal(sum(phi),n)'

version 0.1.3: (2015-05-18)

- In 'plotBASiCSDispVsExp': 'log="xy"' argument added
- In class 'BASiCS_Data': internal checks added (pre-filter of samples and transcripts)
- In 'BASiCS_MCMC' c++ code: Rcpp::checkUserInterrupt() added for fast user-requested interruption of MCMC sampler
- S4 method 'plot' for 'BASiCS_Chain' signature: argument 'Column' replaced by 'Gene' and 'Cell'
- Replacement of 'plotBASiCSNormPhi' and 'plotBASiCSNormS' by S4 method 'plot' ('BASiCS_Summary' signature)
- S4 method 'plot' for 'BASiCS_Summary' signature: does not include plots for all model parameters
- S4 method 'plot' for 'BASiCS_Summary' signature: does not include scatterplots of gene-specific and cell-specific model parameters (replacing 'plotBASiCSExpVsDisp')
- 'BASiCS_VarianceDecomp' has been made visible to users (former 'HiddenVarDecomp' function) and output does now allow gene annotation. 
- 'BASiCS_Filter' function added.
- Vignette has been updated according to the changes above. Instructions for installation were added. 
- 'BASiCS_Filter' function added.
- Dependency to R (>= 3.1.0) has been added.

version 0.1.4: (2015-05-21)

- 'BASiCS_Denoise' function added. It produces a table of normalised and denoised expression counts (after removing the effect of technical variation). 

version 0.1.5: (2015-05-27)
- Small typo in 'BASiCS_VarThresholdSearchHVG' and 'BASiCS_VarThresholdSearchLVG' has been fixed. 

version 0.1.6: (2015-06-01)
- Replacement of parameter-specific 'displayChain's functions by a generic method displayChainBASiCS
- Replacement of parameter-specific 'displaySummary's functions by a generic method displaySummaryBASiCS
- In 'BASiCS_DetectHVG' and 'BASiCS_DetectLVG': constrain added to that prob >= 0.5 is required to detect HVG and LVG

version 0.2.0: (2015-06-24)
- New parametrization for mRNA content size factors $\phi_j$ that improves mixing of the MCMC algorithm (using adaptive Dirichlet proposals)
- Updated vignette

version 0.2.1: (2015-07-23)
- Argument 'GeneNames' has been added to functions 'BASiCS_VarianceDecomp', 'BASiCS_DetectHVG', 'BASiCS_DetectLVG' so that users can specify gene labels or names that will be used for these functions's output. 

version 0.3.0: (2015-07-31)
- New slot BacthInfo in 'BASiCS_Data' class
- Batch-speficic technical variability parameters are allowed
- 'BASiCS_VarianceDecomp' modified to accommodate batch membership (including graphical output)

version 0.3.1: (2015-09-17)
- New slot GeneNames in 'BASiCS_Data' class
- Changes in the constructor `newBASiCS_Data` to allow easier construction of `BASiCS_Data` objects
- Minor changes to some functions' output to use the new GeneNames slot of 'BASiCS_Data' class

version 0.3.2: (2015-10-23)
- Minor changes to the output of `BASiCS_MCMC` function (colnames of the elements related to the parameter $\theta$)
- Addition of extra optional parameter `ls.phi0` to `BASiCS_MCMC` function. This is helpful on situations where the default value led to slow mixing to the chains related to the normalising constants $\phi_j$'s. 

version 0.3.3: (2015-11-05)
- Same method as before but improved performance of C++ code

version 0.3.4: (2015-11-11)
- Fix of example code of 'newBASiCS_Data' function. Thanks to Simon Andrews for pointing out this issue.

version 0.3.5: (2015-11-27)
- Optional argument `PriorDelta` added to `BASiCS_MCMC` function, to allow optional use of `gamma` or `log-normal` priors for delta. 
- In `BASiCS_MCMC` function, change of default value of `s2.mu` to 0.5. Allows better shrinkage in situations where a gene has zero counts across all cells.
- In `BASiCS_Data` class. Count matrices where a gene has zero counts across all cells are now allowed. However, a warning is returned in such case. Only use such matrices when running differential expression results.
