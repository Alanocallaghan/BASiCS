- In 'plotBASiCSDispVsExp': 'log="xy"' argument added
- In class 'BASiCS_Data': internal checks added (pre-filter of samples and transcripts)
- In 'BASiCS_MCMC' c++ code: Rcpp::checkUserInterrupt() added for fast user-requested interruption of MCMC sampler
- S4 method 'plot' for 'BASiCS_Chain' signature: argument 'Column' replaced by 'Gene' and 'Cell'
- Replacement of 'plotBASiCSNormPhi' and 'plotBASiCSNormS' by S4 method 'plot' ('BASiCS_Summary' signature)
- S4 method 'plot' for 'BASiCS_Summary' signature: does not include plots for all model parameters

<<<<<<< HEAD
- 'BASiCS_VarianceDecomp' has been made visible to users (former 'HiddenVarDecomp' function) and output does now allow gene annotation. 
- 'BASiCS_Filter' function added.
- Vignette has been updated according to the changes above. Instructions for installation were added.
