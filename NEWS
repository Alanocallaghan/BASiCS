version 0.2.0: (2015-06-24)
- New parametrization for mRNA content size factors $\phi_j$ that improves mixing of the MCMC algorithm (using adaptive Dirichlet proposals)
- Updated vignette

version 0.2.1: (2015-07-23)
- Argument 'GeneNames' has been added to functions 'BASiCS_VarianceDecomp', 'BASiCS_DetectHVG', 'BASiCS_DetectLVG' so that users can specify gene labels or names that will be used for these functions's output. 

version 0.3.0: (2015-07-31)
- New slot BacthInfo in 'BASiCS_Data' class
- Batch-speficic technical variability parameters are allowed
- 'BASiCS_VarianceDecomp' modified to accommodate batch membership (including graphical output)

version 0.3.1: (2015-09-17)
- New slot GeneNames in 'BASiCS_Data' class
- Changes in the constructor `newBASiCS_Data` to allow easier construction of `BASiCS_Data` objects
- Minor changes to some functions' output to use the new GeneNames slot of 'BASiCS_Data' class

version 0.3.2: (2015-10-23)
- Minor changes to the output of `BASiCS_MCMC` function (colnames of the elements related to the parameter $\theta$)
- Addition of extra optional parameter `ls.phi0` to `BASiCS_MCMC` function. This is helpful on situations where the default value led to slow mixing to the chains related to the normalising constants $\phi_j$'s. 

version 0.3.3: (2015-11-05)
- Same method as before but improved performance of C++ code

version 0.3.4: (2015-11-11)

version 0.3.5: (2015-11-27)
- Optional argument `PriorDelta` added to `BASiCS_MCMC` function, to allow optional use of `gamma` or `log-normal` priors for delta. 
- In `BASiCS_MCMC` function, change of default value of `s2.mu` to 0.5. Allows better shrinkage in situations where a gene has zero counts across all cells.
- In `BASiCS_Data` class. Count matrices where a gene has zero counts across all cells are now allowed. However, a warning is returned in such case. Only use such matrices when running differential expression results. 

version 0.4.0: (2015-12-21)
- Preliminary functions for differential expression analyses (mean and over-dispersion) have been added. 

version 0.4.1: (2016-02-05)
- Fixed bug in vignette (usage of `newBASiCS_Data` function). Same bug has been fixed in documentation of class `BASiCS_Data`. 
- Optional argument 'Start' added to `BASiCS_MCMC` function to allow running chains with a variety of user-defined starting point. In general, we do not advise to use this argument as the default option has been tuned to facilitate convergence. 
- Updated documentation of 'BASiCS_DetectHVG' and 'BASiCS_VarianceDecomp' function (removing 'GeneNames' argument)
- Updated documentation for 'BASiCS_DV_TestDE' function. 
- Missing @description sections added to several .Rd files.
