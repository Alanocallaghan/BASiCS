version 0.1: (2015-04-20)

- Original release

version 0.1.1: (2015-04-21)

- Improved documentation

version 0.1.2: (2015-04-23)

- In 'BASiCS_Sim': change 'sum(phi)==n' by 'all.equal(sum(phi),n)'

version 0.1.3: (2015-05-18)

- In 'plotBASiCSDispVsExp': 'log="xy"' argument added
- In class 'BASiCS_Data': internal checks added (pre-filter of samples and transcripts)
- In 'BASiCS_MCMC' c++ code: Rcpp::checkUserInterrupt() added for fast user-requested interruption of MCMC sampler
- S4 method 'plot' for 'BASiCS_Chain' signature: argument 'Column' replaced by 'Gene' and 'Cell'
- Replacement of 'plotBASiCSNormPhi' and 'plotBASiCSNormS' by S4 method 'plot' ('BASiCS_Summary' signature)
- S4 method 'plot' for 'BASiCS_Summary' signature: does not include plots for all model parameters
- S4 method 'plot' for 'BASiCS_Summary' signature: does not include scatterplots of gene-specific and cell-specific model parameters (replacing 'plotBASiCSExpVsDisp')
- 'BASiCS_VarianceDecomp' has been made visible to users (former 'HiddenVarDecomp' function) and output does now allow gene annotation. 
- 'BASiCS_Filter' function added.
- Vignette has been updated according to the changes above. Instructions for installation were added. 
- 'BASiCS_Filter' function added.
- Dependency to R (>= 3.1.0) has been added.

version 0.1.4: (2015-05-21)

- 'BASiCS_Denoise' function added. It produces a table of normalised and denoised expression counts (after removing the effect of technical variation). 

version 0.1.5: (2015-05-27)
- Small typo in 'BASiCS_VarThresholdSearchHVG' and 'BASiCS_VarThresholdSearchLVG' has been fixed. 

version 0.1.6: (2015-06-01)
- Replacement of parameter-specific 'displayChain's functions by a generic method displayChainBASiCS
- Replacement of parameter-specific 'displaySummary's functions by a generic method displaySummaryBASiCS
- In 'BASiCS_DetectHVG' and 'BASiCS_DetectLVG': constrain added to that prob >= 0.5 is required to detect HVG and LVG

version 0.2.0: (2015-06-24)
- New parametrization for mRNA content size factors $\phi_j$ that improves mixing of the MCMC algorithm (using adaptive Dirichlet proposals)
- Updated vignette
