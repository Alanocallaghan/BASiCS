Description: Single-cell mRNA sequencing can uncover novel cell-to-cell
 heterogeneity in gene expression levels in seemingly homogeneous 
 populations of cells. However, these experiments are prone to high levels
 of unexplained technical noise, creating new challenges for identifying
 genes that show genuine heterogeneous expression within the population of
 cells under study. BASiCS (Bayesian Analysis of Single-Cell Sequencing
 data) is an integrated Bayesian hierarchical model to perform statistical 
 analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing datasets in the context of supervised
 experiments (where the groups of cells of interest are known a priori, 
 e.g. experimental conditions or cell types). BASiCS performs built-in 
 data normalisation (global scaling) and technical noise quantification 
 (based on spike-in genes). BASiCS provides an intuitive detection criterion for highly (or lowly) 
 variable genes within a single group of cells. Additionally, BASiCS can 
 compare gene expression patterns between two or more pre-specified groups of cells. 
 Unlike traditional differential expression tools, BASiCS quantifies changes 
 in expression that lie beyond comparisons of means, also allowing the study 
 of changes in cell-to-cell heterogeneity. The latter are quantified via a 
 biological over-dispersion parameter that measures residual over-dispersion 
 (with respect to Poisson sampling) after normalisation and the removal of 
 technical variation.
